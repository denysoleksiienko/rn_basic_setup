## Install Fonts

#### Step 1: Copy fonts into `./src/assets/fonts`

```bash
# using terminal

npx react-native-asset
```

In iOS, it is important for the font filename to be the same as its PostScript name. To find the PostScript name, open your ttf file with Font Book, see what its PostScript name is and rename the font to it.

#### Step 2: Iniinitialize typography with fonts in the theme `./src/theme`
